## About me

Software, for me, isn't just about work. I'm always tinkering on *something* at any given time!

Currently, that something is an independent adventure game called Mirama!

<br>

As a team lead, my goal has always been to encourage members of the team to develop their autonomy and sense of ownership.

These are qualities that have been very useful to me through my career, and that I want to inspire others to strive for.

My approach for this comes through acknowledgement of work well done, and continuous encouragement to follow-up on delivered work.
